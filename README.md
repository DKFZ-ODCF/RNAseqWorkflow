# RNAseq Workflow

## Software Requirements



### Conda

The workflow contains a description of a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment. A number of Conda packages from [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) are required. You should set up the Conda environment at a centralized position available from all compute hosts. 

First install the BioConda channels:
```
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

Then install the environment

```
conda env create -n RNAseqWorkflow -f $PATH_TO_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY/resources/analysisTools/rnaseqworkflow/environments/conda.yml
```

The name of the Conda environment is arbitrary but needs to be consistent with the `condaEnvironmentName` variable. The default for that variable is set in `resources/configurationFiles/analysisRNAseq.xml`.
